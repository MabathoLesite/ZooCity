                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
    <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals, known for their long necks and legs. They are native to the savannahs and open woodlands of Africa. Giraffes are herbivorous and primarily feed on leaves, fruits, and flowers from trees, using their long necks to reach high branches.</p>
    <p>These animals are social creatures, often found in loose herds. They have a distinctive coat pattern of irregular brown patches separated by lighter lines, which helps them blend into their surroundings.</p>
    <p>Giraffes are known for their unique gait, moving both legs on one side of their body and then the other, which allows them to cover large distances in search of food.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>

                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
    <p>Warthogs are wild pigs found in Africa, known for their distinctive tusks and facial warts. They inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and woodlands, often near water sources.</p>
    <p>These animals are well adapted to their environment, with a tough hide and long legs that allow them to run quickly. Warthogs are primarily herbivorous, feeding on grasses, roots, and fruits.</p>
    <p>Warthogs are social animals and often live in groups called sounders, which consist of females and their young. Males are more solitary and only join the group during mating season.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the warthogs at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>

                            <h3>MONKEY</h3>
    <p>Monkeys are primates that are known for their intelligence, social behavior, and agility. They are found in various habitats, including tropical rainforests, savannas, and mountains. Monkeys are divided into two main groups: New World monkeys and Old World monkeys.</p>
    <p>These animals are highly social and live in groups called troops. They communicate through vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language. Monkeys are also known for their dexterous hands and feet, which allow them to grasp branches and manipulate objects.</p>
    <p>Monkeys are omnivorous and have a varied diet that includes fruits, leaves, insects, and small animals. They are also known to use tools, such as sticks to extract termites from mounds.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the monkeys at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>

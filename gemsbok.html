                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                       
    <p>Gemsboks are large antelopes with long, straight horns and distinctive markings. They are native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly the Kalahari Desert. Gemsboks are well adapted to their harsh environment, able to go without water for long periods by extracting moisture from the vegetation they eat.</p>
    <p>These animals are social creatures, often found in small herds. They are known for their striking appearance, with a tan coat and white facial markings. Gemsboks are also incredibly fast and can reach speeds of up to 60 km/h (37 mph) when running.</p>
    <p>Gemsboks are herbivorous and primarily graze on grasses and shrubs. They are most active during the cooler parts of the day, such as early morning and late afternoon.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gemsboks at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>

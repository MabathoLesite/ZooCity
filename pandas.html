                            <h3>PANDA</h3>
    <p>Pandas are large bears native to China, known for their distinctive black and white coloring. They primarily inhabit bamboo forests and are highly specialized feeders, relying almost exclusively on bamboo for their diet.</p>
    <p>These animals are solitary and spend most of their time eating, sleeping, and climbing trees. Pandas have a unique wrist bone that functions as an opposable thumb, allowing them to grasp bamboo stalks with ease.</p>
    <p>Pandas are classified as vulnerable due to habitat loss and low birth rates. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their natural habitats and increase their populations.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the pandas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>

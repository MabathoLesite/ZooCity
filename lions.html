                            <h3>LION</h3>
    <p>Lions are large carnivorous mammals of the family Felidae and are often referred to as the "king of the jungle." They are native to Africa and parts of Asia, and they live in social groups called prides.</p>
    <p>These animals are known for their powerful build, with males typically weighing between 150-250 kg (330-550 lb) and females weighing 120-182 kg (265-400 lb). Lions have a distinctive mane of hair around their necks, which is more pronounced in males.</p>
    <p>Lions are apex predators and primarily hunt large herbivores such as zebras and wildebeests. They are also known for their cooperative hunting strategies, often working together to take down prey.</p>
    (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout
     sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only 
     surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the
     order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African
      elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of
     4 m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).</p>
     <p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long
     trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting
    water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve 
    as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear 
    flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry 
    their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while 
   Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
   <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including
    savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>

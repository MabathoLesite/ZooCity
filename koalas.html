                            <h3>KOALA</h3>
    <p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia, known for their distinctive appearance and tree-dwelling habits. They have a stout, tailless body, large head, and round, fluffy ears. Koalas primarily feed on eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most animals but provide the koala with the necessary nutrients.</p>
    <p>These animals are mostly nocturnal and spend most of their time sleeping in trees, conserving energy. Koalas have a specialized digestive system that allows them to break down the tough eucalyptus leaves and extract the maximum amount of nutrients.</p>
    <p>Koalas are social animals and communicate through a variety of vocalizations, including grunts and bellows. They are currently listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss, bushfires, and disease.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the koalas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>

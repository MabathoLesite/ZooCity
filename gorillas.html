                            <h3>GORILLA</h3>
    <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates and are native to the forests of central Africa. They are ground-dwelling and primarily herbivorous, feeding on leaves, stems, and fruit. Gorillas are social animals, living in groups led by a dominant male known as a silverback.</p>
    <p>These animals are known for their intelligence and strong familial bonds. They communicate through a variety of vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions. Gorillas are also capable of using tools, such as using sticks to extract termites from mounds.</p>
    <p>Gorillas are critically endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their remaining populations and habitats.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gorillas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
